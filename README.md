Code and usage

The code in this paper is an improvement on the basis of YOLOv8. You can directly copy the code done in this project to the original code path and use it directly.

The three data sets used in this paper are FLIR, KAIST and CVC-14. 

FLIR: https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/

KAIST: https://github.com/SoonminHwang/rgbt-ped-detection

CVC-14: http://adas.cvc.uab.es/elektra/enigma-portfolio/cvc-14-visible-fir-day-night-pedestrian-sequence-dataset/

Since the data set downloaded directly is in voc format, we also provide the code of data set format conversion and division.
